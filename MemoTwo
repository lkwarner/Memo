Dear Ms. Smith, 

As computer engineers, you and your team help keep our web presence appealing, accurate, and up to date. The difficulties lie with keeping style and information consistent. A transition to MadCap Flare can help with these problems. 

MadCap Flare is identified as an authoring and publishing program. Though this program is mainly used for topic based authoring, it can also create and implement HTML and CSS style sheets to all related platforms and documents. When you make one change or update, it automatically applies to all other platforms as well. This will save your team time and headaches trying to make all documents and platforms consistent. Your team will be able to easily create new HTML and CSS style sheets for new projects or documents. 

Once you have created one HTML or CSS file, you can use any part of the data created for new projects. MadCap separates sections of information so that data can easily be reused for other projects. This will save you and your team time recreating similar but different files. 

MadCap Flare is intimidating at first, but there are multiple options to ease the transition. MadCap Flare offers several training webinars to get your team acclimated to the system. If there are any issues not covered in the webinar, MadCap has helpful blogs, forums, videos, and online support. 

MadCap Flare offers many advantages that will benefit the company and I ask for you to think over making the switch over to MadCap Flare. If you have any questions about MadCap Flare and the process of switching over to this new program, you can contact me any time at lkwarner@my.edu.  

Thank you for your time and consideration, 

Lindsay Warner
