Dear Mr. Johnson, 

My team and I have been doing research on a more efficient way of creating and publishing content. We believe that recreating content over and over is wasting time and creating inconsistencies in the documents. After immense research, we suggest implementing MadCap Flare. 

Topic based authoring allows our content to be more consistent, simpler, and with few duplications. We can finally specify a document to fit a specific audience instead writing one and expecting it to cover all audiences. 

MadCap Flare allows us to upload our existing documents where we can then edit and reuse the content. We will no longer have to rewrite the same information for different documents, different manuals and for different platforms. Instead of rewriting manuals for each product with minor differences, MadCap Flare allows us to piece the manual together with modules from previous manuals and make the minor changes that make this manual different. We can easily tag each module of information to help us know where and what type of document it is to be used in. This will save the team time and effort to work on other projects.

We also donâ€™t have to worry about losing style and formatting when using MadCap Flare. The program offers many of the same style functions that are found in Microsoft Word.

Switching over to MadCap Flare is difficult but the company offers several webinars, informational blog, helpful videos, forums, and online maintenance and support. All of these can help make the transition over to MadCap Flare a little smoother. 

MadCap Flare offers many advantages that will benefit the company and I ask for you to think over making the switch over to MadCap Flare. If you have any questions about MadCap Flare and the process of switching over to this new program, you can contact me any time at lkwarner@my.edu.  

Thank you for your time and consideration, 

Lindsay Warner
