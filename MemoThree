Dear Ms. Abraham, 

Keeping up with competitors is a daily battle for our company. As a whole, we work together to tackle each problem that comes our way, but some of the challenges that we face are internal. I believe that the program MadCap Flare can help alleviate these problems within the company. The program is $1000 per computer download. I understand that resources for expansions such as this are limited. However, I do believe that this program can save the company more money in the long run that the initial expense. 

Hours of manpower are wasted daily on rewriting content and checking for consistencies for our multiple platforms. This wasted time impacts potential revenue. Inconsistencies in documentation cause customers to become confused which in turn requires time, effort, and resources to be put toward fixing back-end problems. 

MadCap Flare allows you to upload documents such as manuals, images, videos, or forms and separates the chunks of information so that each can be edited, moved, and reused individually. This capability cuts down on inconsistencies across documentation and platforms, confusion for customers looking for answers, and wasted time by employees rewriting the same information over and over. 

MadCap can also generate style sheets and apply them to all platforms we use to share information. When you update one, all other platforms update together. When every page and document the customer sees is the same, it helps embed our visual identity in their minds. This sets us up as a reliable and user-friendly company to our users. 

Internally, the transition over to MadCap Flare will not be easy. There is an extensive learning webinar that MadCap hosts to teach users the ins and outs of the program. Outside the webinars, MadCap offers an informational blog, helpful videos, forums, and online maintenance and support. These resources can help make the transition over to MadCap Flare a little bit easier to understand. 

MadCap Flare offers many advantages that will benefit the company and I ask for you to think over making the switch over to MadCap Flare. If you have any questions about MadCap Flare and the process of switching over to this new program, you can contact me any time at lkwarner@my.edu.  

Thank you for your time and consideration, 

Lindsay Warner
